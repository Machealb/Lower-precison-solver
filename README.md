# Lower_precision_solver
 Codes of lower precison solver for discrete linear ill-posed problems.
 
 These files include the LSQR algorithm implemented using double and single precision for solving some test
 1 or 2 dimensional problems.
 
The regularization toolbox from "P. C. Hansen, Regularization Tools version 4.0 for Matlab 7.3, Numer. Algor., 46 (2007),
pp. 189–194" and IR Tools from "G. Silvia, H. P. C. Christian, and J. G. Nagy, IR Tools: A MATLAB package of iterative
regularization methods and large-scale test problems, Numer. Algor., 81 (2019), pp. 773–
811" should be included to run our codes.
